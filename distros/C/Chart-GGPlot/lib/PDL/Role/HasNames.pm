=head1 NAME

PDL::Role::HasNames - Role for attaching per-element names to a piddle

=head1 VERSION

version 0.002000

=head1 STATUS

At current stage this module is experimental. It was created for being
internally used by L<Chart::GGPlot>.
Please contact the author if you would like to directly use this module
in your code. 

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use PDL;
    use Role::Tiny ();

    my $p = pdl(1..3);
    Role::Tiny->apply_roles_to_object($p, 'PDL::Role::HasNames');

    $p->names([qw(foo bar baz)]);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This role tries to provide a way to make something similar as R's feature
of the C<names> attribute, which allows attaching a per-element string
name to a vector.

For some PDL methods like C<copy> and C<slice>, the C<names> attribute is
retained in the result. For many other methods, it's lost. 

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 names

Per-element names attached to the piddle.

It's an "rw" attribute.
In the "writer" mode, either an arrayref or a PDL::SV object are
acceptable. PDL::SV is use internally, so in case of an arrayref it
would be converted to a PDL::SV object. The specified value has to be of 
same dimensions as the original piddle.
In the "reader" mode, it returns a PDL::SV object.
