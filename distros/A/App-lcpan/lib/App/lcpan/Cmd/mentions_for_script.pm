Include only records that are addedE<sol>updated since the last index update.

=item * B<added_or_updated_since_last_n_index_updates> => I<posint>

Include only records that are addedE<sol>updated since the last N index updates.

=item * B<added_since> => I<date>

Include only records that are added since a certain date.

=item * B<added_since_last_index_update> => I<true>

=back

Returns an enveloped result (an array).

First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status code
(200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element
($reason) is a string containing error message, or something like "OK" if status is
200. Third element ($payload) is the actual result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth
element (%result_meta) is called result metadata and is optional, a hash
that contains extra information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional metadata.

Return value:  (any)

=head1 CONTRIBUTING


To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull requests on
GitHub.

Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You can
simply modify the code, then test via:

 % prove -l

If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally on your
system), you can install L<Dist::Zilla>,
L<Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR>, and sometimes one or two other
Dist::Zilla plugin and/or Pod::Weaver::Plugin. Any additional steps required
beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
